### hi there 👋

i'm a frontend developer who loves to learn and work with great teams.

🔭 i'm currently working w/react @mintbase, developing the new UI and doing all other things around the platform (https://www.mintbase.io/).

🌱 i'm currently learning about crypto and web3.

⚡ fun fact: i started working as an outsystems developer and then i went to functional analyst. i only started with frontend after these adventures. I also make music in my free time 🎸 (https://open.spotify.com/artist/2I5yjM2Yc82AaQuuMZqQnV)
