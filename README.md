i'm a frontend developer who loves to learn and work with great teams.

ğŸ”­ i'm currently working w/ Angular @ a car-sell platform: www.piscapisca.pt in charge of development of new features and some code refactor and maintenance.

ğŸŒ± i'm currently learning new ways to improve my code.

âš¡ fun fact: i started working as an outsystems developer and then i went to functional analyst. i only started with frontend after these adventures.
